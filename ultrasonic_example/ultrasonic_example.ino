#include <Ultrasonic.h> // This type of import is used for using libraries that have been imported to the
                        // arduino library. This is the recomended way since you don't have to have the
                        // source files in your project.
#include "ultrasonic_example.h" // This is another way to import files however the file MUST exist in the
                                // project folder in order for it to be loaded. This is great for header
